    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 medium orphan (freshly expired preferred, ~45–60 kg works best)</li>
        <li>2½ liters "found family" stock (just tap water + tears, simmered with a whisper of false hope)</li>
        <li>3 large "why me" onions, roughly chopped while ugly-crying</li>
        <li>4 ribs celery nobody wanted</li>
        <li>6 "maybe next year" carrots, still slightly warm</li>
        <li>1 whole "you were supposed to save me" head of garlic, smashed</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves (the only things that stayed)</li>
        <li>1½ cups "it gets better" barley (spoiler: it doesn't)</li>
        <li>1 tbsp "you're so strong" salt (measure with the back of a sympathy card)</li>
        <li>Freshly ground "thoughts and prayers" black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>Optional garnish: one (1) small plush animal that smells faintly of hospital hand sanitizer</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Instructions</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Strip the orphan of anything that might remind people a person once lived inside it. (Clothing, name, unfinished homework, etc.) Set the identity aside—you won't need it again.</li>
        <li>Quarter the remains with the kind of dull knife social services gives foster parents. The resistance is part of the flavor.</li>
        <li>In your largest pot (bonus points if it's the one they used to heat up SpaghettiOs at 2 a.m. while waiting for someone to show up), sweat the onions in a film of orphan grease until they become translucent with regret.</li>
        <li>Add celery and carrots. Cook until they soften and start asking themselves what they did to deserve being here.</li>
        <li>Toss in the garlic and bay leaves. Stir while quietly repeating "it's not your fault" until you no longer believe it.</li>
        <li>Add the meaty bits. Let them brown just enough that the neighbors can smell something and decide not to call anyone.</li>
        <li>Pour in the stock. Bring to a simmer while thinking about every birthday that ended with "maybe next year."</li>
        <li>Add barley. Simmer uncovered for 45–60 minutes or until the grains have absorbed every last drop of optimism in the room.</li>
        <li>Taste. It should be somewhere between "mild disappointment" and "bone-deep futility." Adjust seasoning with more salt and existential dread.</li>
        <li>Ladle into bowls. Float a single plush ear or eye on top if you're feeling festive.</li>
    </ol>
